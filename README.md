# lifelogs
A tool to help you keep track of what you do and how you feel.

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY:
* This is a MEAN project.
  - Install Mongo
  - Install Node (Nodemon is fantastic too, if you're wanting to make changes to the code, and immediately see the results without having to constantly restart the server)
* Start server with "node ./bin/www" (or "")

HOW TO RUN ONLINE:
* Navigate to lifelogs.herokuapp.com

DIRECTIONS:
Please begin by registering for an account and logging in.

Proceed to lifelogs...

1) Select a date (defaults to today's date, but you can choose any date, past and future included)
2) Select the activities that you performed on selected date.
3) Fill out the survey, rating your Physical, Mental & Psychological Wellbeing, on a scale of 1-10 (Worst to Best)
4) Click Submit

As you submit your daily activities and wellbeing metrics, you will notice that the chartJS widget below populates with your personal data. Hovering over any given metric will display your wellbeing for the given metric, as well as the activities you performed on that given day.

Forget to add a particular activity yesterday? Maybe you were away from your computer all day and didn't have a chance to log your activities? No problem. Notice that you can use the calendar widget to traverse through time and edit your activities and survey criteria. Also, notice that past data is preserved for future editing. After you've logged a few days, try going back to a past entry. This app aims to be the diary you need to manage trends in your lifestyle, and this will be reflected in future updates to the site.

Future Ambitions...
* Add more charts and metrics. This app is going to be all about the data baby! Are you curious about your average Phsyical wellbeing when you exercised vs. when you didn't? How about your average Psychological wellbeing when you talked on the phone? It's coming!
* Improve aesthetics. I know this app is kind of plain at the moment. It gets the job done, but visual representation is important in this day and age.
* Implement the ability to add and delete activities. We are all different people with different goals, and different hobbies. Whether or not you went ice fishing is irrelevant to somebody who lives in the Mojave. Allowing you to customize your activity reservoir is going to be a very much needed future addition.

Feedback on Project from Mentor...
* Add specific instructions for users running app locally - STATUS : COMPLETED
* Standardize the random button colors to avoid dark background with dark text. - STATUS : NOT COMPLETED
* More on-screen help to clarify directions, and what the charts represent - STATUS : NOT COMPLETED

Thank you for reading, and thank you for your interest in the project.

Special Thanks:
I am currently participating in a program called Code Louisville, which is a free of charge course provided made possible with grant money from the state of Kentucky. This project was created with the intent to satisfy the criteria of developing a 'final project' for said course. I would like to thank all of the mentors in the program including, but not limited to, both Brians, Wes, and Ernesto. All of these mentors have devoted at least months of their lives to help us students fulfill our goals of becoming developers. Their countless efforts have sent hundreds of students on positive trajectories towards our dreams and have helped foster a sense of self fulfillment in all of use.
